How to move around:
BUTTONS: 
File:
Choose a catalog to load exercises from, remember that catalog has to be XML and right formatted.
Load:
After you chose a catalog, chose an exercise and load it. 
After that the settings-window appeares, chose your settings and move on.
Now you can start working on your exercise.

Test:
You can test your programm before moving on. 
We highly recommend testing your methods for compiler errors!
Cycle:
After you tested everything and made sure that's right, 
you can move on to the next phase by pressing that button.

Settings: 
You can chose a different design probably... some time... not there yet :D

FIELDS:
Tabs:
When you loaded your exercise, you can see all the classes in different tabs, 
you can always switch between them simply by clicking at them and have a look at your other classes, 
if you're not sure what to do next or what you did last. 

TextField upper left corner: 
That is the TextField in which your description appears, after you loaded an exercise.

TextField upper right corner:
In this TextField a list of exercises will appear, after you load it from a XML-file.

TextField bottom center: 
This is your console. You cannot write in it. Use your tests to try out your methods.
